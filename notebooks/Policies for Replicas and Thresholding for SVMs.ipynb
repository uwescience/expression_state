    "Suppose we are given features $x$ such that $x_{ijk}$ is the $i$-th instance, $j$-th feature, and $k$-th replication of that instance and the corresponding class labels $y_i$. This notebook explores the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How should the replicas be used? Averaged? As additional instances?\n",
    "- Does thresholding (of feature values) increase classification accuracy?\n",
    "- How should thresholding be used in combination with replicas?"

    "- Ground truth feature values are taken from a grid of density $D$ in each feature over the range $[-1, 1]$ such that there are $D$ evenly spaced points. So, there are $D^J$ feature values in the ground truth.\n",
    "- Class values are assigned using the separating hyperplane $\\sum_j x_j = 0$ applied to ground truth feature values. A class value of 1 is assigned if $\\sum_j x_j > 0$ and -1 otherwise. The importance of a feature can be weighted by changing the separating hyperplane.\n",
    "- The replications are obtained by adding noise from $N(0, \\sigma^2)$ to each ground truth feature value.\n",
    "- Accuracy is evaluated for feature vectors $\\alpha (1, \\cdots, 1)$ by computing average accuracy for a set $alpha$ and at different $\\sigma^2$. The result of an experiment displays a plot of $\\alpha \\in [-\\epsilon, \\epsilon]$ versus accuracy at a value of $\\sigma^2$."
